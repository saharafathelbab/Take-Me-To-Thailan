The project is not available for viewing due to being unable to find a way to upload PHP files that use the MySQL database onto GitHub.

#### What is the problem and how does Take Me to Thailand solve it?

Problem: Customers were only able to view and order from the menu at the restaurant. This meant that if a customer wanted to order a Take Out, they would have to place the order in person and wait the designated time.
